        <h3>Personal / hobbies</h3>
        <p>I have a big interest in music and listen to a lot of different genres quite oftenly. I am fairly good at the out door activity which is 'airsoft' this is simliar to paint ball but insists of shooting small plastic pellets rather than
          balls of paint. It also includes more realistic looking gear and weapons.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'd like to think I'm fairly good at most video games and this is what I spend most of my time outside of work doing. I also enjoy learning languages, I'm currently studying Japanese and Finnish (not at a quick pace however). I also enjoy
          watching Japanese anime and reading Japanese manga.</p>
